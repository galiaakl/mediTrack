# Introduction
This guide aims at documenting the technologies and techniques employed for the design of MediTrack, a smart healthcare app designed to connect users to medical services in real-time, whether they’re looking for a doctor, a pharmacy, or need immediate emergency assistance. Through the focus on the practicality of this app, one can ensure smooth and quick navigation and effective access to all needed medical guidance with emergency cases and pressing medical needs in mind.
A detailed explanation will be provided of the app implementation, from frontend development, all the way through Backend engineering. The tools and methods deployed will also be discussed and illustrated.

# App Overview and Objectives
MediTrack is a mobile application, developed for deployment on the Android operating system. 
This app serves the public — including patients, parents, seniors and even travelers — and the professionals who want better visibility and organization. 

Powered by a user-friendly interface and a practical usage workflow, this app’s main features include:
## 1) _For regular users_
     - **One-tap emergency access:** users can, without any prior knowledge of the nearest red cross or civil defense stations and their availability or hotlines, dial these services directly and practically through a clear, easy-to-access emergency button that connects them directly to their nearest station. Information about the patient, collected as part of the user’s sign-up process, would be immediately shared with the emergency service for convenience and time saving in dire situations.
     - **Live-Map and navigation:** the app provides real-time access to the map, with exclusive display of medical facilities and listing of their respective services, a function that might not be fulfilled on regular maps service providers for medical search convenience. Users can locate nearby facilities -hospitals, emergency centers, specialized care centers-, pharmacies, and healthcare specialists’ private clinics, with real-time filters like “open now”, “available medications”, and “speciality”.
     - **Medical Doctor Booking System:** users can filter providers by their specialities, years of experience, and location at their convenience. They are offered various booking methods for their clinical appointments, depending on each healthcare professional’s preference and offered options. Patients are also offered a schedule-visualization feature, where they are allowed to view all bookings made through the app.
     - **User profiles:** patients can store medical history, allergies, medications, and emergency contact details – especially useful if unconscious or in crisis.

## 2) _For medical professionals_
-	**Appointment Services:** Doctors can select their preferred methods of booking -regular calls, WhatsApp messaging, email services, MediTrack scheduling services-. They are granted access to the users’ medical profile for fast consultations and recommendations for the situation’s severity does not imply any need for physical appointment.
